// Couldn't get any of the Algorithms to work. I have decided to commit this progress that I would learn Data Structure.


//Update, I hae bought the Data Structure and Algorithm course by Cold Steele onUdemy and would start learning that 
//simutaneously while I continue to code everyday to practice and become familiar with the syntax and how things work generally.

// Today was a very busy day for me, took my Baby to the hospital for check up. Didn't have any code reveiws today,
// but would definintely do some exptensive reminder of the program tomorrow and then review my study.
